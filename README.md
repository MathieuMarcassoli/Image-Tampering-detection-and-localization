# Image-Tampering-detection-and-localization
Within the scope of a research internship, I managed to implement a SRM filter method to localize areas that were tampered on an image.
Our code was implemented using IFS, IMD_2020, and MICC_F600 datasets, they have to be prepared (change ground truth color/delete some images that may cause problems).
Anyway, if you're interested, I hope this code will be of help. Improvements can be made through some data augmentation or by adding other datasets, because it still has some
issues with complex tampering areas. It's up to you to enhance the code, all the tools are here !
